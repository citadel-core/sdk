# Citadel SDK

This package makes it easy to integrate with Citadel.
It is a TypeScript-based wrapper around the Citadel REST API.

This is a very early proof of concept, please do not use it in production.

### Note about ES Modules

This package uses ES Modules. It can only be imported in true ESM projects, not using `require()`.
